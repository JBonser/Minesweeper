# Coding Kata: Minesweeper

This is a Coding Kata that I am using to flex my Test Driven Development(TDD) and C#/Monogame abilities.

The Kata that I am using is located [here](https://codingdojo.org/kata/Minesweeper/)

## Stages Of Development

The first stage of this development will be to follow some strict Test Driven Development to complete the Kata.

Next I would like to take this text based version of the project and use Monogame to visualise the Minesweeper Game.

Finally I would like to go on and implement the full Minesweeper game functionality.
